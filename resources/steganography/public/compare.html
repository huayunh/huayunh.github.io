		<h1>Qualifications</h1>
		<h2 class="instructions">You must be at least 18 years old and not color-blind to be qualified for this study. You should use a desktop or laptop computer (no tablets or mobile phones). Your Internet connection should be stable so that you can complete the task without interruption.</h2>
		<h1>Task</h1>
		<h2 class="instructions">Your task is to decide, between two given images, which one is more complex. Throughout the HIT you will be asked to compare <span class="total-questions">55</span> pairs of images. Two images will be presented at one time, and you will click on the image that you consider to be more complex. There is no particular definition of complexity, other than what your own senses tell you. After you are finished with the comparisons, you will go back to the MTurk page to answer a brief set of questions. </h2>
		<h1>What we record</h1>
		<h2 class="instructions">Aside from your MTurk Worker ID, we record the choices you made between the pairs of images, the time it takes for you to make the choice, and your user agent. We also record the answers you provide to the questions at the end of the study.</h2>
		<h1>Compensation</h1>
		<h2 class="instructions">While there is no right or wrong answer to which image is more complex, the answers you provide must be reasonably consistent, rather than your appearing to have "gamed" the task &ndash; for example by having clicked on all of the left-hand images, or alternating left-right-left-right, or any other discernable response pattern.  If we determine that you have gamed the task, or circumvented reasonable behavior, you will not be compensated for your work.  We will accept or reject your work within 30 days, and upon our acceptance, you will receive $0.50 compensation.</h2>
