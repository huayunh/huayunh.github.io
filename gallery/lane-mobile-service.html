				Designed for Lane Construction, a road construction company, to make use of some emerging phone technologies for their entrepreneurship goals.

			<h3>Task</h3>
			<p> This is an individual task where the students are expected to rearrange, twist a raw piece of plain text about industrial ecology into a very organic digital report, which explains to our client (Disney, Amazon, FAA of my own choice) about the importance of industrial ecology. We are free to gather resourc- es through the internet, and arrange the pictorial and textual materials neatly on a 960px by 650px canvas.</p>

			<div class="in-text-img">
				<img src="asset/Screen Shot 2018-09-29 at 10.50.56 PM.png" />
				<p> I sketched a book map (left) and page layout (right).  I devised a equal-width sixcolumn grid system to achieve the flexibility, because 6 is the least common multiple of 1, 2 and 3. The 5 schemes in the page layout I came up with were serving different purposes: some are relaxing, and some are more serious.</p>
			</div>

			<p>I then went through several iterations to change the grid layout, as well as find the best assets that properly fit my target audiences (the engineers and inspectors of FAA). Besides, I also highlighted some keywords that I think would be useful for my inspector audience, so that they can quickly locate the relevant concepts within the document.</p>

				<p>The evolution of the first three pages during iteration 2 - 4. These three grid templates were used during many following pages and were representative for the trends in the entire documents.</p>
			</div>

			<h3>Result</h3>
			<p>Overall, the final presentation was great. I walked through the entire design for the class and explained my design decisions in detail.  The instructor suggested that the glossary, which I designed for the safety inspectors and was intentionally left at the top to avoid the distraction, could be brought closer to the text to merge with the text altogether through varying on colors. </p>
