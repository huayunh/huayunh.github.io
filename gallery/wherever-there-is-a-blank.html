				Wherever there is a blank, I will try to make use of it and keep my creative spirit up.
			</p>

			<p>Usually, I would draw like this:</p>

				<a href="asset/IMG-0009.JPG"><img src="asset/Screen Shot 2018-10-03 at 6.07.12 PM.png" /></a>
				<p>A panoramic drawing of mine consists of 13 vanishing point. On the left it's a crowded market from the ancient East; on the right it's a ancient Western village. In the center is a modern megacity, bridging the East and the West. I did this in 5 hours, with a vague idea to begin with, and improvizing on the details as I go. How might the consumers stand by the window and think about their glorious past? What if people try to run on the roof above the tiles but almost fell off? How will they keep the balance? Who will ring the bell for the whole village to wake up in the morning shine? <br />(Click the picture to enlarge)</p>

			<p>Like this:</p>
			<div class="in-text-img">
				<a href="asset/IMG-0025.JPG"><img src="asset/cfa.jpg" /></a>
				<p>College of Fine Arts, pencil Sketch.<br />(Click the picture to enlarge)</p>
			</div>

			<p>Or do it digitally, like this:</p>
			<div class="in-text-img">
				<img src="asset/IMG_5142.jpg" />
				<p>An archer from a tribe, named "Nora". The drawing is done in PhotoShop and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paint_Tool_SAI">SAI</a>.</p>
			</div>

			<h3>But</h3>
			<p>Sometimes graffitis carry the mission to spread creativity among a conservative company.</p>

			<div class="in-text-img">
				<img src="asset/IMG-7155.JPG" />
				<p>My manager's whiteboard was never empty when I was there. I gave him a surprise while he was traveling. In this drawing I drew everything except for the dinosaur on the top right and the person on the bottom left. One day the company's CTO walked pass by my manager's office, and soon my manager was known by all the executives as "the-guy-with-a-big-doodle-on-his-whiteboard". They liked it.</p>

			<p>Or surprise people in a parking lot!</p>
			<div class="in-text-img">
				<img src="asset/IMG-7553.JPG" />
				<p>A floating steel ball, reflecting its surroundings in the Gates garage. I did this with charcoals and chalks.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="in-text-img">
				<img src="asset/f3af3abe-00c1-48c3-aa1e-0b0f1c3d8f76.jpg" />
				<p>Rubik's Cube, also located at the Gates garage. In this picture there was a professor of mine, and he sent this photo to his friend, who replied "what are you doing with a Rubik's Cube on the floor?"</p>
