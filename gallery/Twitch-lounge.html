			<h3>Demo</h3>
			<div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.24%"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/De6O-Fjq7Qg?ecver=2" style="position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
			<p>There is a live demo hosted on Herokuapp: <a href="https://twitch-lounge.herokuapp.com/">Invite your friends and roam in the lounge together!</a></p>

			<h3>Conception</h3>

			<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch.tv">Twitch.tv</a> is an online game streaming platform. Usually when people enter a channel, there is a live streaming video, with a chat room on its right. However the chat room is just like an upgraded IRC, with no hierarchies showing people's relationships in the chat room. Besides, the chat history scrolls really fast, and is very hard for people to digest. How can we redesign the chat room to mimic conversations in the real life?</p>

			<div class="in-text-img">
				<img src="asset/ScrDesign 01-1.png" />
				<p>People's in-chat relation might look like constellations. An edge between two nodes (two viewers) denotes their interactions. The brighter the edge is, the more recent the interactions are. The bigger the node is, the more popular its corresponding view is. The yellow one denotes the streamer themselves, while the purple one denotes the user.</p>
			</div>

			<p>I then went through several iterations to change the grid layout, as well as find the best assets that properly fit my target audiences (the engineers and inspectors of FAA). Besides, I also highlighted some keywords that I think would be useful for my inspector audience, so that they can quickly locate the relevant concepts within the document.</p>

				<p>The evolution of the first three pages during iteration 2 - 4. These three grid templates were used during many following pages and were representative for the trends in the entire documents.</p>
			</div>

			<h3>Result</h3>
			<p>Overall, the final presentation was great. I walked through the entire design for the class and explained my design decisions in detail.  The instructor suggested that the glossary, which I designed for the safety inspectors and was intentionally left at the top to avoid the distraction, could be brought closer to the text to merge with the text altogether through varying on colors. </p>
